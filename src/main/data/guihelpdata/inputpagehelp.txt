If the document you are describing is a txt or csv file you have to set the delimiter on which the fields are separated. This usually is a ",". If however your document is an excel file you have to specify which sheet you want to read.\n\nWhen you've set all the Document variables you can add or remove columns. Per column you have to specify the number of the column, and give it a name. After that you can select which type of Document it is: A String, int or Date.
