The input code Area
<html>
	<body>
	<h2>What is the input code area?</h2>
	<p>
		The input code area is an textfield in which you can enter queries. These queries have to be specified in a language which is described at the next help button.You can enter one or multiple queries on one or multiple lines. These will be excecuted in sequential order, which means that the second queries will be excecuted on the resulting data of the first query.<br/><br/> When you are done specifying the queries you can hit the ANALYSE button to make the program procces the queries.

Language
<html>
	<body>
	<h2>How does the language work</h2>
	<p>
		The language has a certain form which consist of 2 or 3 sections. The first word is always the kind of operation you want to use. Some of these operations are followed by parenthesis filled with a string to use as additional input of the operation. The options are:
	</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>Chunk</li>
	  <li>Code(String)</li>
	  <li>Comment(String)</li>
	  <li>Filter</li>
	  <li>Connection(String)</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		The string is the code or comment you want to set, and with connection it is the String you want to associate with the connection. The second sections specifies on which part of the data you want to use your operation. There are multiple options to specify the data : 
	</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>code WHERE = ...</li>
	  <li>code WHERE equals ...</li>
	  <li>comment WHERE = ...</li>
	  <li>comment WHERE equals ...</li>
	  <li>data ...</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		After data you can write an SQL query, in which you can name the columns of the table from the input tab. The Connections method needs both ends of a connections, so you can specify the third section in the same way as the second section.

	<p>
		After filling in queries in the code area and the user presses the ANALYSE button, the intermediate result area shows the data after the the queries have been excecuted on the current data set. Before the first query this area will contain all data available after the file selection in the InputPage tab.
